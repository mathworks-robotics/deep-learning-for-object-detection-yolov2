## Introduction

This repository consists of the code files for the following videos, dataset used for this code can be found here : https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1bhohhPoZy03ffbM_rl8ZUPSvJ5py8rM- ;

1. Data Preprocessing for Deep Learning : https://www.mathworks.com/videos/data-preprocessing-for-deep-learning-1578031296056.html 
2. Design and Train a YOLOv2 Network in MATLAB : https://www.mathworks.com/videos/design-and-train-a-yolov2-network-in-matlab-1578033233204.html
3. Import Pretrained Deep Learning Networks into MATLAB : https://www.mathworks.com/videos/import-pretrained-deep-learning-networks-into-matlab-1578034627950.html
4. Deploy YOLOv2 to an NVIDIA Jetson : https://www.mathworks.com/videos/deploy-yolov2-to-an-nvidia-jetson-1578035533852.html

## SetUp

1. Clone the repository.
2. Launch Deeplearningforobjectdetection.prj to set-up the project environment.
3. Download the data from this google drive folder : https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1bhohhPoZy03ffbM_rl8ZUPSvJ5py8rM- 
4. The first time you run this example, edit appropriately and run ***adjustGroundTruthPaths.m*** to adjust the ground truth data objects' source path for your computer. Instructions on the edits needed are in the code file.

## Folder Structure

1. **Codefiles** folder consists of matlab code files for each of the videos
2. **Utilities** folder consists of .mat files required for uplaoding pre trained content
