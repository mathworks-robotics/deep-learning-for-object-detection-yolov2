## Set-Up

1. Clone the repository.
2. Launch ***Deeplearningforobjectdetection.prj*** to set-up the project environment.
3. Download the data from this folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1bhohhPoZy03ffbM_rl8ZUPSvJ5py8rM- 
4. The first time you run this example, edit appropriately and run ***adjustGroundTruthPaths.m*** to adjust the ground truth data objects' source path for your computer. Instructions on the edits needed are in the code file.

## Folder Structure

1. **codeFiles** folder consists of MATLAB&reg; code files for each of the videos and a sample Simulink&reg; model
2. **Utilities** folder consists of .MAT files required for uplaoding pre-trained content and helper functions
